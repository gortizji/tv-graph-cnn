# Multidomain Graph Convolutional Neural Networks

The code in this repository implements an efficient generalization of the popular Graph Convolutional Neural Networks to multidomain graph signals, presented in my MSc. Thesis:

G. Ortiz-Jim√©nez. [Multidomain Graph Signal Processing](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A6fd6b441-1694-473e-a317-b60d168f19a7?collection=education) MSc. Thesis, Delft University of Technology, Aug 2018.

This repository is an extension from the code in https://github.com/mdeff/cnn_graph .

## Requirements

To run this code you need to install the following libraries:

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org): Tested on v1.4.1
* [PyGSP](http://pygsp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
